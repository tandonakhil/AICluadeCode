# conclave-finance-studio

## Overview

**Conclave Finance Agentic Studio** — a multi-agent AI system for finance
accountants. Ships working close agents, and lets accountants clone, tweak and
combine them into agentic teams for month-end close.

- **Created**: 2026-07-30
- **Template**: pending `plan-agent` recommendation
- **Surfaces**: desktop web · mobile web · native mobile (**multi-surface**)
- **Data**: financial data warehouse, sourced from Oracle ERP Cloud
- **Write-back**: yes — per-action explicit human approval
- **Current stage**: gate 1 · Intake

## Active Team

**Approved 2026-07-31 — full roster, 14 agents. Nothing dropped.**

Core (8): `plan-agent`, `functional-design-agent`, `code-agent`, `test-agent`,
`verification-agent`, `review-agent`, `deploy-agent`, `ui-ux-designer`.

Optional, all retained, each with a named obligation that would otherwise go
unowned:
- `solution-architect` — **non-droppable by rule** (three surfaces); owes the
  mandatory Impact Analysis on every change
- `responsible-ai-architect` — **non-droppable in practice**; owes the A7.2
  harm analysis delegated to it at Intake
- `security-architect` — owns `industry-expert`'s eleven compliance
  obligations (ICFR scope, IPE testing, 7-year WORM retention, SoD)
- `functional-agent` — devil's advocate at Plan and Architecture; found the
  self-justifying-reconciling-item mechanism and the builder's author-role SoD
  defect
- `industry-expert` — owns the compliance floor, which is the binding
  constraint on this product
- `synthetic-data-agent` — close agents cannot be tested on real ledger data

**Test Policy: all suites blocking.** No advisory exceptions. Ledger write-back
and ICFR scope make an advisory suite a hole in the control narrative.

**Estimate at approval**: 5–8M tokens, from 2 comparable data points
(`conclave-marketing` ~4.8M, `little-milestones` ~5.0M). Stated as a planning
input, not a prediction; upper end uncertain because the MVP slice is
undecided.

## Decisions Log

- **2026-07-30 — Intake.** Gathered one question per turn in the console, per
  the standing rule recorded that same day. Full record: `INTAKE.md`.
- **2026-07-30 — Product shape: BOTH.** Pre-built close agents *and* a builder
  for custom agents/teams. Chosen over builder-only and closed-system-with-
  agents. Widest scope of the three; makes "which half ships first" the central
  MVP question.
- **2026-07-30 — Personas: all three.** Staff accountant, controller/close
  manager, FP&A analyst. Doer, supervisor, explainer.
- **2026-07-30 — Write-back with per-action approval.** Not read-only, not
  autonomous. Creates binding obligations: audit trail per write, rollback,
  segregation of duties, and an approval UI legible under close-deadline
  pressure.
- **2026-07-30 — A7.2 (worst harm) and A8.3 (MVP slice) DELEGATED to SMEs.**
  Recorded as answers, not gaps. Consequence: `responsible-ai-architect`
  becomes effectively non-droppable.

- **2026-07-31 — SCOPE CORRECTION (human).** The system is **not** the General
  Ledger. It runs on top of Oracle ERP Cloud data in a warehouse, triggers
  postings into ERP, and leaves all ERP/GL features in the GL. Its job is to
  **detect and resolve anomalies** during a standard close. *"Do not imitate
  GL."* This invalidated F6/F7/F8/F11 — a matching engine, statement ingestion,
  auto-certification rules and a certification workspace are Oracle Account
  Reconciliation Cloud. `functional-agent` had already called bank rec the most
  commoditised activity in the domain; the correction turns that from a
  positioning risk into a scope error. The spine (F1–F5, F12, F13) and the
  cross-period detectors (F9, F10) survive — all of those are about the agents,
  not the ledger.
- **2026-07-31 — PRODUCT DIRECTION (human), two parts.** (1) Build the backlog
  from research into which close activities AI agents can genuinely automate —
  anomaly detection, balancing, coding issues. (2) The surface is a
  **natural-language, skill-based interface**: select one or more datasets, ask
  an agent to act or automate **under guardrails**.
- **2026-07-31 — STANDING AUTHORIZATION to build MVP1.** Gates go to the SMEs
  for review and their judgement is trusted; the orchestrator makes necessary
  assumptions rather than returning for each. Recorded as `batch_authorized`,
  **not** `approved` — the human authorized the run, not each gate. Every
  assumption lands in this log so it is reviewable after the fact.

- **2026-07-31 — MVP1 SCOPED TO ERP DATA ONLY (human).** Both SMEs independently
  escalated the same undecidable: does the pilot warehouse carry non-Oracle
  sources? Human's answer: **start narrow, ERP-only for MVP1; additional sources
  are future phases.**

  **Why this is viable despite both SMEs warning that single-source Oracle means
  "Oracle's Ledger Agent wins and we are a worse-positioned copy":** the three
  differentiators they identified do not depend on source count.
  1. **Omission detection** — "the product detects what did not happen". The
     evidence of an absence is *not in the ledger*, so a ledger-resident agent
     cannot see it however many systems feed that ledger. Needs a multi-period
     expectation model, which ERP history alone supplies.
  2. **Resolution typing + evidence spine** — R1–R6 resolution model, forward
     disposition, dossier. Source-independent.
  3. **Cross-period surveillance** (`DOMAIN_KB` §6.2) — invisible in-period by
     construction, which is why no incumbent sells it. Source-independent.
  Plus `DOMAIN_KB` §10.4c: most coding errors originate in the subledger, where
  Oracle's Payables Agent codes pre-post one document at a time — **we are the
  net that catches what it let through**, post-hoc and ledger-wide. Explicitly
  survives an all-Oracle estate.

  **Deferred to phase 2, not abandoned**: the cross-system seam as a headline,
  cross-source omission detection, and warehouse-vs-ERP fidelity as a
  *differentiator* (it stays in MVP1 as an integrity check, per `DOMAIN_KB`
  §10.5 — it is the credibility floor, not the wedge).

  **Standing instruction**: continue making assumptions, take SME judgement, and
  loop to MVP1 without returning for per-gate approval.

- **2026-07-31 — Gate 4 ambiguity 1 resolved: the refusal surface gets a feature
  ID, F50.** `functional-design-agent` found it binding (backend module,
  frontend directory, test criterion §11.G-42, seven AC IDs) but with no feature
  row and no approval line. Making it "a cross-cutting property the 17
  collectively carry" means nobody owns it, and an unowned surface is what gets
  cut in week ten. Build-now count → **18**, exactly at the ceiling. A19–A22 are
  load-bearing *refusals*: "not built yet" and "will never be built" are the
  same screen to a user and opposite answers to an auditor.
- **2026-07-31 — Gate 4 ambiguity 2 resolved: F42's cut-marking is withdrawn.**
  `PLAN.md` §7.4 marked F42 "the first thing I would cut", but §11 criterion 21
  — the test that proves the wedge is real rather than asserted — requires F42
  as the **negative** side of a paired comparison. Cutting F42 removes the
  ability to demonstrate the wedge at all. F42 is re-marked **TABLE STAKES,
  not cuttable while criterion 21 stands**. If a later gate wants F42 gone it
  must first say how the wedge gets demonstrated without it.
- **2026-07-31 — Gate 4 closed, `batch_authorized`.** 186 acceptance criteria
  across 18 features. Every UI-bearing feature carries at least one
  observable-UI criterion; F2 and F12 have exactly one each and the narrowness
  is flagged rather than hidden. §12 carries a standing exclusion: **no
  criterion asserts explanation quality and none may be added**, per
  `INDUSTRY_KB` §15.4 — clearer AI explanations make reviewers defer *more*.
