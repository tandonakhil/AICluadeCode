# conclave-finance-studio

## Overview

**Conclave Finance Agentic Studio** — a multi-agent AI system for finance
accountants. Ships working close agents, and lets accountants clone, tweak and
combine them into agentic teams for month-end close.

- **Created**: 2026-07-30
- **Template**: pending `plan-agent` recommendation
- **Surfaces**: desktop web · mobile web · native mobile (**multi-surface**)
- **Data**: financial data warehouse, sourced from Oracle ERP Cloud
- **Write-back**: yes — per-action explicit human approval
- **Current stage**: gate 1 · Intake

## Active Team

**Approved 2026-07-31 — full roster, 14 agents. Nothing dropped.**

Core (8): `plan-agent`, `functional-design-agent`, `code-agent`, `test-agent`,
`verification-agent`, `review-agent`, `deploy-agent`, `ui-ux-designer`.

Optional, all retained, each with a named obligation that would otherwise go
unowned:
- `solution-architect` — **non-droppable by rule** (three surfaces); owes the
  mandatory Impact Analysis on every change
- `responsible-ai-architect` — **non-droppable in practice**; owes the A7.2
  harm analysis delegated to it at Intake
- `security-architect` — owns `industry-expert`'s eleven compliance
  obligations (ICFR scope, IPE testing, 7-year WORM retention, SoD)
- `functional-agent` — devil's advocate at Plan and Architecture; found the
  self-justifying-reconciling-item mechanism and the builder's author-role SoD
  defect
- `industry-expert` — owns the compliance floor, which is the binding
  constraint on this product
- `synthetic-data-agent` — close agents cannot be tested on real ledger data

**Test Policy: all suites blocking.** No advisory exceptions. Ledger write-back
and ICFR scope make an advisory suite a hole in the control narrative.

**Estimate at approval**: 5–8M tokens, from 2 comparable data points
(`conclave-marketing` ~4.8M, `little-milestones` ~5.0M). Stated as a planning
input, not a prediction; upper end uncertain because the MVP slice is
undecided.

## Decisions Log

- **2026-07-30 — Intake.** Gathered one question per turn in the console, per
  the standing rule recorded that same day. Full record: `INTAKE.md`.
- **2026-07-30 — Product shape: BOTH.** Pre-built close agents *and* a builder
  for custom agents/teams. Chosen over builder-only and closed-system-with-
  agents. Widest scope of the three; makes "which half ships first" the central
  MVP question.
- **2026-07-30 — Personas: all three.** Staff accountant, controller/close
  manager, FP&A analyst. Doer, supervisor, explainer.
- **2026-07-30 — Write-back with per-action approval.** Not read-only, not
  autonomous. Creates binding obligations: audit trail per write, rollback,
  segregation of duties, and an approval UI legible under close-deadline
  pressure.
- **2026-07-30 — A7.2 (worst harm) and A8.3 (MVP slice) DELEGATED to SMEs.**
  Recorded as answers, not gaps. Consequence: `responsible-ai-architect`
  becomes effectively non-droppable.

## Current Status

Gate 1 · Intake — **awaiting human approval**.
